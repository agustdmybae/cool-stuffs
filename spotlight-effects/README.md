# Spotlight Effects with GSAP

My practice of spotlight effects. 
I followed this great tutorial from [DesignCourse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6z8MYjZ_J8) and turned it into a React version.
Set up of the React app was referenced from [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Notes

This is my first try with Greensock and it was fun!!
